\textbf{Dear Editor and Reviewers:}

We hereby resubmit a paper titled “xxxxx” to the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.
The original log number is TSE-2025-xx-xxxx.

We sincerely appreciate the valuable comments and suggestions regarding our manuscript. 
We have carefully considered all the points and have made the necessary revisions to the manuscript, which we hope will meet with your approval.

We submitted the previous version to TSE in September, handled by Prof. XXX.
And the paper got the “XXXX”. 
Hence, we revised the paper a bit and addressed all of the reviewers’ comments. 
Since Prof. XXXX handled our paper in the last round, we strongly recommend him to be the editor of our paper again.

Thank you once again for your time and consideration.

Best, \\
xxx
